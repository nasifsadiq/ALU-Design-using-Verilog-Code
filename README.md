Project:
Design a 4-bit ALU capable of performing 4 different arithmetic or logical operations using
Quartus, implement it using Verilog HDL, and verify it using a timing diagram.
Specifications:
The ALU takes two four-bit inputs: A, B, and a three-bit operation code (opcode). Based on
the opcode, it performs five different operations on A and B and produces a four-bit output, C.
Depending on the result of a particular operation, the ALU also produces three flags: carry,
zero and sign flag. Fig. 1 illustrates the block diagram of the ALU.
